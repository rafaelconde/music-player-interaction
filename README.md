music-player-interaction
========================

I'm experimenting with Quartz Composer to build some interactions/animations

##Interactions so far:

* Fade in/out of the controls
* Pull out of the player view
* Scroll on Player and Discovery view
* Bounce in of the mini player after hiding the main view
* Tapping the mini player summons the main view
